# AusLaw MCP

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Australian and New Zealand legal research. Searches AustLII for case law and legislation, retrieves full-text judgements with paragraph numbers preserved, and supports OCR for scanned PDFs.

**Status**: ✅ Working MVP with intelligent search relevance

## Features

### Current Capabilities
- ✅ **Case law search**: Natural language queries across all Australian and NZ jurisdictions
- ✅ **All jurisdictions**: Commonwealth, all States/Territories (VIC, NSW, QLD, SA, WA, TAS, NT, ACT), and New Zealand
- ✅ **Intelligent search relevance**: Auto-detects case name queries vs topic searches
  - Case name queries (e.g., "Donoghue v Stevenson") use relevance sorting
  - Topic queries (e.g., "negligence duty of care") use date sorting for recent cases
- ✅ **Multiple search methods**: Title-only, phrase, boolean, proximity searches
- ✅ **Pagination**: Retrieve additional pages of results with offset parameter
- ✅ **Legislation search**: Find Australian and NZ legislation
- ✅ **Primary sources only**: Filters out journal articles and commentary
- ✅ **Citation extraction**: Extracts neutral citations `[2025] HCA 26` and reported citations `(2024) 350 ALR 123`
- ✅ **jade.io URL support**: Fetch document text from jade.io URLs (requires user access)
- ✅ **Paragraph preservation**: Keeps `[N]` paragraph numbers for pinpoint citations
- ✅ **Multiple formats**: JSON, text, markdown, or HTML output
- ✅ **Document retrieval**: Full text from HTML and PDF sources (AustLII, jade.io)
- ✅ **OCR support**: Tesseract OCR fallback for scanned PDFs

### Roadmap
- 🔶 **jade.io integration**: Partial support - users can provide jade.io URLs for document fetching
- 🔜 **jade.io search**: Pending API access from jade.io for search integration
- 🔜 **Page numbers**: Will extract page numbers from reported versions
- 🔜 **Authority ranking**: Will prioritise reported over unreported judgements

See [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for detailed development plans.

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/russellbrenner/auslaw-mcp.git
cd auslaw-mcp
npm install
npm run dev  # hot reload for local development
```

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## MCP Registration
Configure your MCP-compatible client (eg. Claude Desktop, Cursor) to launch the compiled server.

For Claude Desktop, edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "auslaw-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/auslaw-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/auslaw-mcp` with the actual path to your installation.
