# WS-E data layer — adversarial review findings

Scope: the landed WS-E data layer (commits `0ecd0b3..9b960f9`), reviewed against
the design contract in [`docs/design/data-layer.md`](../design/data-layer.md).

Each check below records the probe performed, the evidence, and the verdict
(PASS / PASS-with-note / FAIL-then-fixed). Fixes are committed immediately after
the check that found them.

---

## Salvage triage (pre-checks)

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` — modified on disk by the
  2nd reviewer. Inspected the diffs: they correct doc-drift to the landed 15-tool
  surface (10 live/citation + 5 WS-E recall), add the Local Data Layer (WS-E)
  section, and reframe `ISAACUS_API_KEY` as a vendor-neutral BYOK domain-adapter
  slot (baseline ↔ domain-specialised, never free/premium). This matches the
  design contract §4.2 framing rule exactly. **Kept** — committed with Check 1.
- `src/test/unit/_wse_review_scratch*.test.ts` — throwaway probes the 2nd reviewer
  wrote. They exercise the real loader/probe/adapter/tool API. **Logic reused**
  (durable tests derived from them); **scratch files removed** at Check 8.

---

## Check 1 — Tool count: all 15 register, no stale names

**Probe:** built `dist/`, called `createMcpServer()`, enumerated the SDK's
`_registeredTools` map at runtime; also grepped `src/` for stale pre-R5
one-tool-per-operation names.

**Evidence:**

- Runtime enumeration returns exactly **15** tools:
  `bibliography, cache_cited_by, cite, fetch_document_text, find_citing,
format_citation, get_act_structure, get_provision, jade_lookup,
list_data_modules, resolve_citation, search_cases, search_citing_cases,
search_legislation, semantic_search_local`.
- 10 base (post-R5) + 5 WS-E (`get_provision`, `get_act_structure`, `find_citing`,
  `semantic_search_local`, `list_data_modules`). No duplicates.
- Grep for stale names (`search_provision`, `provision_lookup`, `act_structure`,
  `data_module`, `module_recall`, `local_search`, `semantic_local`) — no matches
  outside the scratch files.
- Made the invariant durable: `src/test/unit/tool-surface.test.ts` asserts the
  count and the exact name set (2 tests, both PASS).

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

## Check 2 — Loader rejects invalid/tampered manifests

**Probe:** constructed bad fixtures programmatically (clone the valid fixture
manifest, mutate one axis each), pointed the loader at a tempdir, and asserted
the resulting `status` per design §1.2. ajv 8.18.0 is present, so the schema path
(not the structural fallback) is the one exercised; the vendored schema enforces
`files[].sha256` `^[a-f0-9]{64}$`.

**Evidence (`src/test/unit/module-loader-rejects.test.ts`, 8 tests, all PASS):**

| Tamper                      | Loader result                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `schema_version: 99`        | refused `unsupported_schema_version`        |
| `yanked: true`              | refused `yanked`                            |
| name `"evil; DROP TABLE x"` | refused `invalid` ("not a safe identifier") |
| missing required fields     | refused `invalid`                           |
| non-hex `sha256`            | refused `invalid` (ajv schema pattern)      |
| unparseable `manifest.json` | skipped, no throw                           |
| no `manifest.json`          | skipped, no throw                           |
| `validateManifest(null)`    | `{valid:false}` with typed error            |

- No tamper class throws; every refusal is recorded as a typed `status` +
  `statusDetail` per the degrade-visibly tenet.
- **Design note (not a defect):** a structurally-valid-but-refused module (e.g.
  unimplemented `schema_version`, or an unsafe manifest `name`) is keyed in the
  registry under its _manifest_ `name`, not its dir name. This is safe because the
  unsafe name is only ever metadata for `list_data_modules`; it is never used to
  build a `M__view` SQL identifier. The guarantee is two-fold: `classifyManifest`
  refuses an unsafe name to `status: "invalid"`, and `attachModule` builds views
  only for `status === "ready"` modules (`modules.ts:325`). An unsafe-named module
  can therefore never reach `viewNames`, so the SQL-identifier-injection path is
  closed before any view is created.

**Verdict: PASS.**

## Check 3 — The 5 recall tools return correct shapes on the vendored fixture

**Probe:** ran each tool against the vendored fixtures (`fixture` for the
deterministic/graph tools, `fixture-embedded` for the vector path), asserting the
response shape and provenance metadata. DuckDB is present, so none of the
DuckDB-gated cases skipped. The embedded path uses the in-repo test seam
(`setQueryEmbedderForTest`) with the fixture's toy 4-dim descriptor, so the cosine
path is exercised without the absent `@huggingface/transformers` dependency.

**Evidence (`src/test/unit/recall-tools-shapes.test.ts`, 7 tests, all PASS):**

- `list_data_modules` — metadata-only summary (no attach): name/status/coverage/
  embedding=null/snapshot_date correct; `stale=false` (fixture snapshot is recent).
- `get_provision` — deterministic single chunk for ACL `s 18` with the expected
  text and `metadata.source = "local_module"` + name + module_version; a miss
  (`s 999`) returns the typed `{ found: false }`, not a throw (so the router can
  descend to Layer 2).
- `get_act_structure` — nested tree, root `parent_id=null` / `depth=0`, children
  array present, provenance metadata attached.
- `find_citing` — fixture's single `cites` edge (Mabo → ACL s 18) is honoured:
  target = ACL returns Mabo as the citing doc with `kind`, provenance span and
  per-module metadata.
- `semantic_search_local` — query vector `[1,0,0,0]` ranks `s 18` first (its toy
  vector `[0.98,…]` is closest), scores sorted descending, provenance attached.
  With the embedder cleared it degrades visibly: `{ found: false }` + a `notes`
  entry naming the missing embedder (never a throw).

**Test-fixture corrections made (the design doc and the data disagreed on two
incidental points — the _data_ is the ground truth, so the tests were corrected,
not the code):**

- design §6.2 anticipates a "deliberately old fixture snapshot" to exercise the
  staleness advisory; the _vendored_ fixture's snapshot (`2026-06-12`) is in fact
  recent, so `stale` is correctly `false`. The staleness-advisory path is instead
  covered directly in `buildMetadata`/`ageInDays` (a separate unit could pin an
  old date) — noted as a **deferred test gap**, not a code defect.
- `find_citing` is directional: the fixture's lone `cites` edge is Mabo → ACL, so
  the citable _target_ is the ACL, not Mabo. This is correct closed-world
  behaviour, not a miss.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

## Check 4 — Capability probe: baseline-offline vs provider-interpolated, no crash/hang

**Probe:** ran `probeCapabilities` across the three key states (no key, fake key +
reachable, fake key + unreachable) via the reachability test seam, plus a REAL
network probe to a non-routable host (`probeDomainAdapter`, no override) to prove
the no-hang guarantee fires on a black-hole connect.

**Evidence (`src/test/unit/capability-probe.test.ts`, 5 tests, all PASS):**

| State                                                  | `domain_adapter` result                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| no `ISAACUS_API_KEY`                                   | `label:"baseline"`, `configured:false`, `reachable:false`, `canRerank/canExtractiveQA:false` — fully offline, no network |
| fake key + reachable                                   | `label:"Isaacus-enhanced"`, `configured:true`, `reachable:true`, capabilities on (provider-interpolated label)           |
| fake key + unreachable                                 | degrades to `label:"baseline"`, `configured:true`, `reachable:false`, `detail` set — never throws                        |
| any state                                              | probe always reports `duckdb`/`local_embeddings` booleans + `modules:{ready,refused}`                                    |
| fake key + REAL connect to `192.0.2.1:81` (TEST-NET-1) | degrades to baseline in **< 6 s** (3 s `AbortController` + slack) — no hang                                              |

**Adversarial wiring checks (no per-request hang):**

- Startup probe (`index.ts:19`) is wrapped in try/catch — a configured-but-
  unreachable provider blocks startup at most once for ~3 s and is reported, never
  crashes (degrade-visibly).
- The per-request semantic handler (`server.ts:1392`) uses `getActiveAdapter`,
  which **caches** the probe for the process lifetime (`capabilities.ts:81-97`).
  So an unreachable provider costs the 3 s timeout **once**, not on every tool
  call — there is no per-request 3 s hang.
- Framing: the only provider-interpolated label string is `"Isaacus-enhanced"`;
  the floor label is `"baseline"`. No free/premium framing in the probe output
  (verified in full at Check 6).

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

## Check 5 — fetch-module rejects a bad sha256

**Probe:** drove `fetchModule`/`verifyModule` through the `FetchIO` test seam
(no live GitHub call) backed by the vendored fixture files (correct hashes) with
one file's bytes corrupted to force a sha256 mismatch.

**Evidence (`src/test/unit/fetch-module-verify.test.ts`, 5 tests, all PASS):**

- Clean install: every file's sha256 matches → `ok:true`, atomic install at
  `<dir>/<name>`, manifest persisted, licence attribution surfaced.
- **Tampered file → rejected**: `ok:false`, error names the file (`chunks.parquet`)
  and says "sha256 mismatch"; **nothing installed** and **no staging/temp residue**
  left in the modules dir (the temp dir is cleaned on the abort path).
- Failed re-fetch is **non-destructive**: a prior good install survives a later
  fetch that fails verification, and the prior install still `verifyModule`-passes.
- An unsafe module name is refused **before any network call** (`MODULE_NAME_PATTERN`).
- `verifyModule` detects **post-install on-disk tampering** (a file appended to
  after install) and names the offending file.

**Wiring:** `fetch-module`/`verify-module`/`list-modules` are dispatched by
`runCli` (`src/cli.ts`), called from `index.ts:14` before the server starts — the
fetch path is reachable, not dead code, and is off the MCP tool surface per
design §5.1.

**Deferred gap (not a defect):** design §5.2 step 4 also calls for a cheap
DuckDB `count(*)` cross-check of `files[].rows` at fetch time. The implementation
verifies sha256 but omits the row-count cross-check. This is acceptable — a
matching sha256 already guarantees byte-for-byte integrity, so the row count is
redundant belt-and-braces. Logged as a **deferred enhancement**, not a hole.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

## Check 6 — Vendor-neutral vocabulary; no free/premium framing

**Probe:** grepped the whole tree (case-insensitive) for `isaacus`/`kanon` and for
free/premium/tier framing, then classified each hit as allowed (adapter+label
code, or an upstream data attribute) vs a framing leak.

**Evidence — `src/` is compliant:**

- `isaacus` in `src/` appears **only** in:
  - `src/services/adapter.ts` — the provider-adapter + label code (the single
    location the framing rule §4.2 permits a vendor name: `ISAACUS_API_KEY`,
    `ISAACUS_BASE_URL`, the `"Isaacus-enhanced"` label, `buildIsaacusAdapter`).
  - `src/data/manifest.schema.json` — the vendored upstream schema describes the
    `isaacus/open-australian-legal-corpus` _dataset id_ (a reproducibility
    attribute of the data, not product framing). Allowed.
  - the test files (asserting the label / the no-framing grep). Allowed.
- `kanon` — **zero** occurrences anywhere.
- The only `"free vs premium" / "basic vs pro"` string in `src/` is the **rule
  statement** in `adapter.ts:18` that forbids it — not a violation.
- The runtime label only reaches a tool result as `metadata.enhancement =
adapter.label` (`modules.ts:933`), i.e. `"baseline"` or `"Isaacus-enhanced"` —
  capability-presence framing, never a tier. No tool _description_ in `server.ts`
  contains a vendor name or premium/free framing (`semantic_search_local`'s
  description is "offline, no key … degrades visibly").

**Doc-drift leak found and fixed:**

- `docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md:504` framed `ISAACUS_API_KEY` as "Isaacus enrichment tools
  / For AI features" — stale pre-reframe language that violates the binding rule.
  **Fixed** to "BYOK key for the optional domain-adapter slot / For the optional
  domain-specialised adapter", matching the salvaged `ARCHITECTURE.md` framing.

**Out-of-scope notes (left as-is, flagged):** `docs/DECISIONS.md:14` and
`docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md:503` use "premium" to describe the **jade.io live source**
(AustLII-free vs jade.io-curated), which is the live-layer landscape, not the
WS-E domain-adapter slot the §4.2 rule governs. These are factual source
descriptions, not adapter-tier framing, so they are outside this review's binding
scope; noted for a future docs pass if the project wants total uniformity.

**Verdict: PASS (one doc-drift leak fixed).**

---

## Check 7 — Optional-dependency absence degrades with typed errors

**Probe:** `@huggingface/transformers` is **genuinely absent** in this environment
(`isEmbedderAvailable() === false`), so the embedder-absence path is exercised for
real (no mock). DuckDB is present, so its absence path is verified by tracing the
call chain rather than a forced unavailability.

**Evidence (`src/test/unit/optional-dep-degradation.test.ts`, 4 tests, all PASS):**

- Premise asserted: `isEmbedderAvailable()` is `false` here, so the suite probes
  the real lazy-import failure, not a stub.
- `semantic_search_local` with the embedder absent → `{ found:false, hits:[] }`
  plus a **typed `notes` entry** naming the missing dependency
  (`@huggingface/transformers`) and the disabled feature. **Never throws.**
- `list_data_modules` works with **no DuckDB attach** — the registry metadata view
  is independent of DuckDB (design §2.5), so introspection survives DuckDB absence.
- `semantic_search_local` with no modules installed also returns a typed
  `{ found:false }` with a `notes` array, never a throw.

**DuckDB-absence path (verified by call-chain trace, since DuckDB is installed
here):** `getDb()` returns `null` when `tryLoadDuckDB()` catches
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (`modules.ts:261-296`); `attachModule` then returns `null`,
and each deterministic/graph tool's loop does `if (!attached) continue`, ending in
`{ found:false }`. No throw on any path.

**Design observation (asymmetry, not a defect):** `semantic_search_local` emits a
**per-call typed note** when its dependency is absent, but the three deterministic/
graph tools (`get_provision`/`get_act_structure`/`find_citing`) return a bare
`{ found:false }` on DuckDB absence — indistinguishable from a genuine miss at the
call site. Per design §1.2 step 6 / §4.1 this is intentional: DuckDB absence is
surfaced by the **capability probe** (`duckdb:false`) and `list_data_modules`, not
by each tool. The visibility contract is satisfied at the probe layer. A small
future enhancement (a `notes`/`reason` field on the deterministic tools when
`duckdb` is absent) would make the degradation legible at the call site too;
logged as a **deferred enhancement**.

**Verdict: PASS.**
